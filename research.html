            <h2>Matter-Chern–Simons theories</h2>
            <p>
                With Shiraz Minwalla (SM) and collaborators, I studied matter-Chern–Simons theories \cite{Minwalla_2025}, which are remarkable for their demonstrated Bose–Fermi dualities \cite{Aharony:2012nh}, wherein the spectrum of a bosonic theory matches that of a fermionic one under an explicit map between the coupling constants at the level of the thermal free energy. No other examples exist of such exciting dualities between bosons and fermions for non-supersymmetric quantum field theories. Over the last fifteen years, this is the first time anyone has been able to reproduce the thermal free energy calculation for this theory in an alternative gauge than the one chosen in the initial literature \cite{Giombi:2011kc, Jain:2012qi}. We achieved this technical feat in \cite{Minwalla_2025} elegantly, where we also set up the problem amenable to more physically attractive and non-trivial settings (like surfaces of a sphere or torus and, in principle, over general genus-\( g \) spatial Riemannian manifolds), which was not possible with the previous choice of gauge.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a first foray into uncharted territory, we computed the partition function for the fermionic theory on the surface of a finite-sized sphere in our follow-up work \cite{minwalla202X:CSMonS2} using spin-weighted (monopole) spherical harmonics to expand the fermions in an eigenbasis of the Dirac operator on the surface of the sphere. We have uncovered some incredible physics: unlike in the flat-space case, here we get flux-dependent thermal masses and a whole ensemble of such flux-dependent quasiparticles \cite{vatsal-youtube}. Performing a statistical sum over them (to obtain the free energy) proves to be a challenging task though; in flat space, this sum (by virtue of no dependence of quasiparticle masses on fluxes) gave us the quantization of temporal holonomies that was useful in demonstrating the Bose–Fermi duality (it must work out in some other manner for matter-Chern–Simons theories on curved spatial manifolds). We look to investigate the possibility of phase transitions between different flux configurations as the dominant contributors to the free energy before reporting these results. These fluxes correspond to the spatial components of the gauge fields on the 2-sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solving the theory on the torus is straightforward now: the integration over the spatial holonomies enforces additional constraints to be solved, while the expansion of fermions is much simpler. Subsequently, we would be interested in a direct computation of the partition functions of these non-supersymmetric matter-Chern–Simons theories on the 3-sphere, which has remained elusive except through sophisticated techniques of supersymmetric localization (for supersymmetric theories) \cite{Marino:2016new} and surgery theory \cite{Witten:1988hf}.

            <h2>Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev model</h2>
            <p>
                With Sandip Trivedi (ST) and collaborators, I prepared numerical simulations for various generalizations of the Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model (such as including a sum over \(q\)-body interactions and turning a non-zero mean for the strength of these interactions) with varying degrees of locality, solvability, and randomness. We also computed the entanglement scrambling in the associated Hayden–Preskill scenario \cite{Hayden:2007cs} (with the SYK Hamiltonian as the scrambler) with the motivation to study information retrieval à la \cite{Yoshida:2017non} in these models and their quantum chaotic behaviour as understood from their out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs).
            </p>
            <p>
                With ST, Nandini Trivedi (Ohio State U.), and collaborators, I investigated the chaotic properties of the complex SYK model with a finite mean for the Gaussian distribution of randomly drawn couplings at finite temperature and chemical potential \cite{mukherjee202X:CSYK}. The goal is to realize it as a random all-to-all interaction in the highly degenerate, lowest Landau level of an irregular graphene flake/bilayer graphene in a strong magnetic field \cite{PhysRevLett.121.036403}, to have an experimental realization of the complex SYK model as a laboratory prototype of a coarse-grained, charged, (near-)extremal AdS black hole in lower dimensions. We perform exact diagonalization to obtain the many-body density of states (MB-DoS), level-spacing statistics, spectral form factor, OTOCs, residual (thermodynamic) entropy, ground-state entanglement entropy, ground-state compressibility (zero-temperature variation in specific charge with chemical potential), and thermopower (change in entropy per unit charge).
            </p>
            <p>
                We find that with increasing mean over variance, a finite spectral gap emerges in the MB-DoS, the ground state becomes more compressible yet less entangled, early-time chaos is non-maximal (though the model is still a fast-scrambler), intermediate-time chaos is less profound (the system is more ordered), and in the late-time regime, we recover the Wigner–Dyson distribution for the nearest-neighbour spacings. The non-Fermi liquid behaviour persists along with residual entropy and ground-state entanglement (although to a lesser degree), but the spectral asymmetry (thermopower) increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is remarkable that even in the absence of an analytic large-\(N\) solution, many essential qualitative aspects of the large-\(N\) behaviour are exhibited by the finite-mean, finite-\(N\) model (wherever possible, we have analyzed scalings with \(N\)), shared with the class of black holes mentioned. This model is also a rare example where quantum chaotic behaviour of a system can be continuously controlled with a tuning parameter (the ratio of mean over variance). Computing the quantities above, we identify indisputable signatures of a finite mean that can be observed in experiments.

            <h2>Finite-temperature electronic structure theory</h2>
            <p>
               I applied the formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theories \cite{sen_2017, Laine:2016hma} to electronic structure theory for my bachelor’s and master’s theses at IITB, building up on the seminal works of Debashis Mukherjee (DM) from three decades earlier \cite{sanyal1992thermal, sanyal1993systematic, sanyal1994optimal, mandal1998thermal, mandal2002non, mandal2003finite}. DM had proposed an operator-based finite-temperature many-body theory \cite{sanyal1992thermal, sanyal1993systematic, sanyal1994optimal} that worked for both bosons and fermions. However, its path-integral counterpart \cite{mandal1998thermal, mandal2002non, mandal2003finite} was only defined for bosonic systems. I developed a single ansatz-free framework \cite{vatsal202X:FTEST} that describes finite-temperature, non-equilibrium, non-perturbative, strongly-correlated, relativistic, many-body phenomena for fermions within the path integral formulation with analytical solutions accessible at the mean-field level, providing a qualitatively better mean-field description than the Hartree–Fock method, even admitting a sensible zero-temperature limit. This is usually elusive in the conventional treatment of systems without special symmetries preserved throughout, as Kohn and Luttinger showed \cite{PhysRev.118.41, PhysRev.118.1417}, and might thus posit a resolution to their long-standing conundrum.
            </p>
            <p>
                My next goal in this enterprise is to perform beyond-mean-field calculations by setting up an appropriate Monte Carlo simulation and benchmarking the mean-field computations along the way before submitting my work for publication to ensure a self-contained, impactful presentation. I won an institute research award for my thesis, which is rigorously evaluated and rarely conferred (on the recommendation of my formal advisor, four thesis examiners, two additional department-appointed award examiners, and the department undergraduate council chaired by the Department Head and represented by five members of the faculty).

            <h2>String field theory</h2>
            <p>
                With Harold Erbin (HE), I have also discussed working on covariant closed string field theory, exploring ways to bypass the no-go theorem \cite{Sonoda:1989sj} against a possible cubic formulation of the theory in the fashion of Witten’s open bosonic string field theory. HE suggests using auxiliary fields (as in \cite{Erbin:2023hcs}) for a Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation of the non-polynomial action, with the “interaction” terms (products of string fields) written using the higher brackets of an IBL\textsubscript{$\infty$} homotopy algebra, to obtain a cubic action.
